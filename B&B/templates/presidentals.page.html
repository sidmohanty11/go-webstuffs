            <p>Presidential suites are the most luxurious accommodations offered by hotels. Brands typically offer only one or two
            suites of this caliber at a given property. These suites capture the most discerning luxury travelers and are a key
            differentiator when targeting the high-rated international guest segment.
            
            The guest segment for these multibedroom retreats is nicheâ€”think celebrities, heads of state and their inner-circle
            staffers, CEOs and high-net-worth individuals.
            
            From an investment perspective, presidential suites are lucrative due to the high average daily rates they can achieve.
            The decision to invest in a presidential suite requires a thoughtful market and competitive set analysis.
